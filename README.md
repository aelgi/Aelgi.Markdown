# What is this
This library is aimed at providing a straight forward and extendable way of parsing markdown and converting it to a desired output (e.g. HTML, Blazor)

# When is this
Development started late 2019 with the drive from the Aelgi Engine and the need to parse a markdown file to be shown on a blog website

# Where is this
Currently being driven by the Aelgi dev team, the source is provided on GitHub

# Why is this
Because there exists no clear Markdown solution for dotnet and I hope this becomes that
